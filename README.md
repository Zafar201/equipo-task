## Configuring Firebase

This application uses Firebase. Before running the application, you need to replace the Firebase configuration with your own:

1. Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Obtain your Firebase configuration object
3. Replace the Firebase configuration in the project with your own. The configuration file is typically located at `src/firebase/config.js` or similar.

**Important:** Never commit your Firebase API keys to version control. Consider using environment variables for sensitive information.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

* `npm run dev` - Runs the app in development mode.
* `npm run build` - Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.
* `npm run preview` - Locally preview the production build.
